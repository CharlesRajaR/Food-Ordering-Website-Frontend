# 🍽️ RCR-FoodEase – Empowering Local Restaurants with Direct Orders

## 🚀 Overview

**RCR-FoodEase** is a simple, commission-free online food ordering platform designed for small restaurants. Unlike major platforms like Swiggy and Zomato, FoodEase gives restaurant owners full control over their profits by removing high commission charges and offering tools to build a direct relationship with their customers.

---

## 💼 The Problem with Existing Platforms

### Platforms like Swiggy & Zomato:
- Charge **15%–30% commission** on every order
- Impose **packaging, cancellation, and penalty fees**
- Restrict access to **customer data**, limiting loyalty and feedback
- Create **dependency** on third-party delivery agents and algorithms

> 💡 For a restaurant making ₹50,000 in monthly sales, up to ₹10,000 goes to platform commissions—often more than half of their net profit!

---

## ❗ Real-World Challenge

Many small restaurant owners struggle to stay profitable on food delivery apps. High commissions and hidden charges leave little to no margin on each order.

---

## ✅ Our Solution: Direct Tipping for Restaurants

### 🎯 Feature: “Tip the Chef” – 100% to the Restaurant

After every order, customers are prompted:
> _“Enjoyed your meal? Leave a tip for the kitchen staff 🍲”_

- 💵 Customers can tip a fixed amount (₹10/₹20/₹50) or enter a custom amount
- 🧾 100% of the tip goes **directly to the restaurant**—not to the platform
- ❤️ Encourages appreciation for chefs and staff
- 🔁 Boosts restaurant revenue **without raising prices**

---

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- Developed a **React + Tailwind** frontend with a clean and mobile-friendly UI
- Backend powered by **Spring Boot** with secure **JWT-based authentication**
- Integrated a tipping module:
  - Added a tip input on the order confirmation page
  - Extended backend order API to store and process tips
  - Tips are displayed on restaurant dashboards
- MySQL stores all order and tip data for transparent reporting

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
